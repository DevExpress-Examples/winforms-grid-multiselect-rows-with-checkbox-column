# WinForms Data Grid - How to use an unbound checkbox column to select data rows

The [Grid View](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3464/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/views/grid-view) in the [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid) control can display a built-in checkbox column. Users can use the checkbox column to select multiple rows.

Do the following to enable the checkbox column:
- Enable the [View.OptionsSelection.MultiSelect](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.ColumnViewOptionsSelection.MultiSelect) option.
- Set the [View.OptionsSelection.MultiSelectMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridOptionsSelection.MultiSelectMode) property to `CheckBoxRowSelect`.

In v18.1+, you can sync row selected states with a Boolean field in the bound data source. A checkbox column's bound mode ensures that row selection persists whenever you filter or group grid data.

Read the following topic for more information: [Multiple Row Selection Using Built-In Check Column and Selection Binding](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/16439/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/focus-and-selection-handling/multiple-row-selection-via-built-in-check-column-and-selection-binding).
